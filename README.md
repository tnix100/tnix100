# Hello!
Hi, I'm Tnix! I use GitHub for all sorts of things nowadays, mainly contributing to group projects and storing my school/personal projects. I mainly program in Python, but I know some JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. I mainly do backend development, never trust me with frontend design.

# Projects
### [Meower](https://meower.org)
Meower has definitely been the project I have spent the most amount of time on the last 7 months. It originally started as a social media on Scratch, but then after we changed from a whitelist system to a blacklist system using Python better-profanity, the Scratch Team no longer liked us.

I mainly started with Meower Mobile, which continued until Beta 5 and the 2nd server rewrite. I'm now a manager, moderator, and backend developer. Currently developing the [Beta 6 API](https://github.com/meower-media-co/Meower-Server/milestone/1).

### My Website
Non-existant. But I own the domain `tnix.software` (got it for free through GitHub education pack). I don't know what exactly to put on it, but probably will just be a devlog of my projects.

### School Projects
Nothing really interesting, just websites, and databases in SQL and PHP.

### Minecraft WebSockets and Addons
I used to do quite a bit of development with Minecraft WebSockets and addons in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. I no longer do any development here, and all my public projects have been removed.

I created quite a few cool things though, such as a fully usable Skyblock plugin fully powered by WebSockets. Using addons with JavaScript to cancel chat messages and send to the WebSocket to handle custom commands.

### Discord Bots
I don't actively develop many bots, the only one that I have kind of actively worked on has been a Discord bot for the Meower Discord. It's used as a chat bridge, warning system, Meower account linking for verification, @someone, and a few other things. But Meower Robot is in need of a overhaul at some point, probably after Beta 6. 

I used to make Discord bots for multi-purpose things, or stuff that is unique to certain Discord servers, such as a music bot in my friend's server after Rythm shutdown, and in my own servers where I had a bot to sync bans across my servers and some of my friend's servers.



# Projects that I would like to shoutout
### [Nextcord](https://pypi.org/project/nextcord/)
Nextcord is a fork of Discord.py, that started due to Discord.py being discontinued. I was there when they chose the name and was the first one in their Discord server. But can't say much else other than that. I made the first bot that got added to their server as well, it was buggy as hell and was quite funny.

Nextcord is an amazing replacement for Discord.py, and has been the library of choice for many of my friends and I for a while now.

### [CloudLink](https://github.com/MikeDev101/cloudlink)
CloudLink is a very powerful WebSocket extension for Scratch. Whether you're making a game, a chat application, or just storing simple information and don't want to use cloud variables, CloudLink is a great option for realtime networking within your Scratch project.
